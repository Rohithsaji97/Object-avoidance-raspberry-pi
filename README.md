# Object-avoidance-raspberry-pi
An object avoidance system using Raspberry Pi and an ultrasonic device.
This is a simple code using Raspberry Pi.
The ultrasonic sensor is used for the continuous measurement of distance throughout.
With the help of a motor driver the DC motors are rotated clockwise and anti-clockwise
which helps the movement of the rower (turn left or right).
All together integrating both functions the rover successfully avoids obstacles to move forward.
